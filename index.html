            <p>I have a lot of ametuer experience in web development. However, I'm still new, so I'm excited to learn more!</p>
            <p>I enjoy following online tutorials for massive web-dev projects, they've actually taught me a lot about workflow and new, different TechStacks.</p>
            <p>My current favorite Tech Stack is Appwrite, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and a cool program called Shadercn/ui.</p>
            <p>I'm using this shiny new webstack to make a social media app with infinite scroll, which is really fun and cool.</p>
